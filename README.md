# Basic Neural Analyses for IBL data
List of basic techniques to find correlations between neural and neural or non-neural time series. These techniques should be of interest to most IBL members, robustly applicable to IBL data and eventually available to all as DataJoint functions. These functions take as input behavioral, video and neural time-series, already spike-sorted and cleaned. These data analysis techniques should be basic and robust, and complement more advanced methods that the theory group will develop in another body of code.
